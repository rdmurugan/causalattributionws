## Quick Start (Cloud API)

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.causalmma.com/api/v1/attribution \

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "touchpoints": [
      {
        "customer_id": "c1",
        "timestamp": "2025-01-01T10:00:00",
        "channel": "email",
        "conversion": 0
      },
      {
        "customer_id": "c1",
        "timestamp": "2025-01-01T12:00:00",
        "channel": "paid_search",
        "conversion": 1,
        "conversion_value": 100
      }
    ],
    "attribution_model": "data_driven"
  }'
```

## Quick Start (Local SDK)

```bash
pip install causalattribution-client
```

```python
from causalattribution_client import CausalMMAClient
import pandas as pd

client = CausalMMAClient(license_key="YOUR_LICENSE_KEY")

touchpoints = pd.DataFrame([
    {"customer_id": "c1", "timestamp": "2025-01-01T10:00:00", "channel": "email", "conversion": 0},
    {"customer_id": "c1", "timestamp": "2025-01-01T12:00:00", "channel": "paid_search", "conversion": 1, "conversion_value": 100}
])

results = client.analyze_attribution(touchpoints, attribution_model="data_driven")
print(results)
```

## Attribution Models

| Model | Description | Best For |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `data_driven` | AI-powered causal inference with doubly robust estimation | Most accurate results |
| `shapley` | Game-theoretic fair credit distribution | Provably fair attribution |
| `propensity_score` | Propensity score matching | Comparing similar customers |
| `instrumental_variables` | Two-stage least squares | Handling unmeasured confounding |
| `time_decay` | Recency-weighted attribution | Recent touchpoints matter more |
| `position` | First & last touch emphasized | Awareness + conversion focus |
| `linear` | Equal credit to all touchpoints | Baseline comparison |
